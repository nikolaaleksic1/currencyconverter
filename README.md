# CurrencyConverter

This is Currency Converter, project, where you can exchange money value from/to (rsd, eur, usd).
Source data (value) has been used from (https://api.kursna-lista.info/b7b80a59415046c33449b6a2a96bd4d8/kursna_lista).

For this project I used programming languagesa such as Jquery, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP.
It's easy to run this APP --> I ran it on XAMPP web-server on my machine. As you can see it has just three files. 
One is for script files, second is for html and last for css. Also in html I used bootsrap framework because it' s easier and 
faster to write code.
